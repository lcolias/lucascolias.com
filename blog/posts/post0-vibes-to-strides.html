				<h1 class="full-row">The Idea</h1>
				<p class="text-auto">This Vibes to Strides blog is a self admittedly unoriginal idea
					that many software engineers do. Creating an archive of software and programming
					related projects then publishing detailed instructions on how to recreate them
					seems to be the formula of this space. I believe this has partially contributed
					to the recent “Vibe Coding” phenomena and as a delinquent engineer who primarily
					“Vibe Coded” in the past, I’m a guilty party and contributor to this current
					climate. I stopped when I began to notice that this was really negatively
					affecting my critical thinking ability. Initially I cut off all how-to articles
					and LLMs to get back to how I studied in college, using documentation and
					reference examples directly from the technology publisher I was using. This
					produced positive cognitive results but I also noticed the time I took to
					complete tasks was also increasing. So I decided I would strike a balance, only
					using “Vibe” like references to answer my questions instead of using it to
					provide complete solutions. All that to say I want this blog to hold a balance
					of providing solutions while also informing the reader on why certain design and
					implementation choices were made.
				</p>
				<h1 class="full-row">The Goal</h1>
				<p class="text-auto">I want to create content that builds on topics that I’m interested
					in and also reinforces concepts I already know. I believe the best way to gauge
					if I really understand something is to be able to teach what I learned. The
					focus will be on computer science and programming related topics but I’ll
					occasionally include some personal interests and opinions. The secondary
					intention for this blog is to help me practice my communication skills both in a
					technical and interpersonal way. I’ve always had trouble when it comes to
					explaining my thoughts to others so I want to take the time that I’m writing
					these posts to be clear and concise. Any additional benefits I may stumble upon
					in this process will just be icing on the cake.</p>
				<h1 class="full-row">The Execution</h1>
				<p class="text-auto">
					I’ll be setting an expectation of myself to post or update a post at least once
					a month. I think that is fairly enough time to brainstorm a new topic and engage
					with it enough to have learned something that is worth passing along. This will
					most likely be a rough start but I hope that for those who do end up reading
					some of these posts will be kind enough to provide feedback that I build upon
					going forward.
